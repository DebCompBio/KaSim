* Dead rules :
------------------------------------------------------------
rule 2: r2 will never be applied.
rule 3: r3 will never be applied.

------------------------------------------------------------
* Dead agents :
------------------------------------------------------------
C is a dead agent.

------------------------------------------------------------
* Relational properties:
------------------------------------------------------------
In agent A, the internal state of site y is p, if and only if, the internal state of site z is p.

------------------------------------------------------------
* Non relational properties:
------------------------------------------------------------
The binding state of site z in agent A is always free.
The internal state of site z in agent A ranges over u and p.
The internal state of site y in agent A ranges over u and p.
The binding state of site y in agent A is always free.

* Static information
At rule_id:2, the potential tuple pair when there is an action binding between the site y of C and the site y of C is: C(y:C@y, x:u); C(y:C@y, x:p)
At rule_id:2, the potential tuple pair when there is an action binding between the site y of C and the site y of C is: C(y:C@y, x:p); C(y:C@y, x:u)

At rule_id:2: the potential tuple pair when there is a bond on the rhs between the site y of C and the site y of C is: C(y:C@y, x:u); C(y:C@y, x:p)
At rule_id:2: the potential tuple pair when there is a bond on the rhs between the site y of C and the site y of C is: C(y:C@y, x:p); C(y:C@y, x:u)

The potential tuple pair when there is a bond on the rhs between the site y of C and the site y of C is: C(y:C@y, x:u); C(y:C@y, x:p)
The potential tuple pair when there is a bond on the rhs between the site y of C and the site y of C is: C(y:C@y, x:p); C(y:C@y, x:u)


* Dynamic information
Whenever the site z of A and the site y of C are bound together, then the site y of A and x of C can have the following respective states: p, u
