* Relational properties:
------------------------------------------------------------
In agent A, the internal state of site z, the internal state of site y, and the internal state of site x, are entangled by the following 3-d relationship:
	A(z~u,y~u,x~u)
	A(z~u,y~p,x~p)
	A(z~u,y~u,x~p)
	A(z~q,y~p,x~0)
	A(z~u,y~q,x~q)
	A(z~q,y~q,x~q)
	A(z~u,y~u,x~q)

------------------------------------------------------------
* Non relational properties:
------------------------------------------------------------
The internal state of site z in agent A ranges over q and u.
The internal state of site y in agent A ranges over q, p, and u.
The internal state of site x in agent A ranges over q, 0, p, and u.
