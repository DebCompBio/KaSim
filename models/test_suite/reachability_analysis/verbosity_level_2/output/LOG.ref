A(x~q,y~u,z~u)
A(x~q,y~q,z~q)
A(x~q,y~q,z~u)
A(x~0,y~p,z~q)

* Cartesian abstraction:
------------------------------------------------------------
The state of the site x~ in agent A ranges over u, p, 0, and q.
The state of the site y~ in agent A ranges over u, p, and q.
The state of the site z~ in agent A ranges over u and q.
