The binding state of site x in agent A is always B@x.
The internal state of site x in agent A is always u.
The internal state of site x in agent B ranges over u and p.
The binding state of site x in agent B ranges over free and A@x.

When the agent A has its site x bound to the site x of a B, then its site A.x x (B@x,u) and B.x x (A@x,u) is equal to u, u


When the agent B has its site x bound to the site x of a A, then its site B.x x (A@x,u) and A.x x (B@x,u) is equal to u, u
