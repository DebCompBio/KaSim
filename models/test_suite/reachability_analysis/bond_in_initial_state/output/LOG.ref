The binding state of site x in agent A is always B@x.
The internal state of site x in agent A is always u.
The internal state of site x in agent B ranges over u and p.
The binding state of site x in agent B ranges over free and A@x.

 A.x and B.x is equal to u,u when A.x is connected to B.x
In agent A, the internal state of site x, and the binding state of site x, are entangled by the following 2-d relationship:
	A(x~u,x!B@x)


 B.x and A.x is equal to u,u when B.x is connected to A.x
In agent B, the binding state of site x, and the internal state of site x, are entangled by the following 2-d relationship:
