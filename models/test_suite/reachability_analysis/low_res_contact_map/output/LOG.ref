* Dead rules :
------------------------------------------------------------
rule 2: r2 will never be applied.

* Dead agents :
------------------------------------------------------------
C is a dead agent.

------------------------------------------------------------
* Relational properties:
------------------------------------------------------------
In agent A, the internal state of site y is p, if and only if, the internal state of site z is p.

------------------------------------------------------------
* Non relational properties:
------------------------------------------------------------
The internal state of site z in agent A ranges over u and p.
The internal state of site y in agent A ranges over u and p.
The binding state of site z in agent A is always free.
The binding state of site y in agent A is always free.
