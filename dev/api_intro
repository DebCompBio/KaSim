The main entry point of KaSim executable is main/KaSim.ml but let's
describe the API bottom-up.

The folder dataStructures/ has a transparent name. You can find there:
{!modules: LargeArray SetMap Operator Nbr NamedDecls Location}
Some pretty printing utilities are here too:
{!modules: Pp Pp_svg Pp_html}
Including the KaSa machinery:
{!modules: Loggers}


In term/ directory stands all definitions the simulator works on.
{!modules: Agent_place Signature Connected_component
Instantiation Alg_expr Raw_mixture Primitives Environment Kappa_printer }

In grammar/ are the parser and the compilers
{!modules:LKappa Expr Snip}

The module to store and manipulate the state of the simulation are in
siteGraph/
{!modules: Edges Navigation}

The simulation engine is in simulation/
The core of the interpreter
{!modules: Expr_interpreter Rule_interpreter State_interpreter}
and some storage and rendering
{!modules: Counter Plot Outputs}

The machinary to cook stories from an execution trace is in cflow/
{!modules: Compression_main Utilities Priority}

The code of the static analyser is in KaSa_rep/reachability_analysis/
Functor that convert a domain with internalized communications to a top-level module
