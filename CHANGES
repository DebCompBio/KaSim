From KaSim 3 to KaSim 4
=======================

- Options '-t' '-e' and '-p' have desappeared!

You should specify the limit of simulation by '-l' and the plot period
(how often you want a data line) by the "new" '-p'. These options are
by default in "simulated time unit" but you can switch to event using
'-u event'.

Motivation is interactivity. You can now not specifing any limit and
your simulation will run forever ... (well until a Ctrl-c).

- Data files are comma separeted value (instead of space separeted
  value) by default.

The default name of the output file is therefore 'data.csv'.

KaSim can also generate (based on the extension of the output file)
tsv or svg files.

Motivation is to deal with weird values (infinity, not a number) in a
way understood by (at least Gnuplot, Python, Matlab, ...)

- There is no special case for "observables"

Number of occurence of the pattern pat is now written |pat| and it can
be putted in any algebraic expression.

To be concrete, you need to write
%var: 'o' |A(x!1),B(x!1)|
instead of
%var: 'o' A(x!1),B(x!1)
But you can write directly
%var: 'o' 1 + |A(x!1),B(x!1)| / 2
instead of
%var: 'tmp_o' A(x!1),B(x!1)
%var: 'o' 1 + 'tmp_o' / 2

As a (more or less direct) consequence, you can write
%init: "any algebraic expression" "mixture"
and
$TRACK "pattern" [true]

- Ctrl-c does not stop the simulation

It pauses it and launch a toplevel in which you can do modification
(as in perturbations) and then (optionnaly) continue the simulation.

You can use '-mode batch' if you want Ctrl-c to kill the simulation
(and more generally KaSim to never ask questions) or '-mode
interactive' to pause the simulation just after the initialisation
phase.

Concretly the old behavior of Ctrl-c and then y(es I want a snapshot)
is recovered by Ctrl-c and the modification
$SNAPSHOT "dump.ka"; $STOP

- Rates for unary instances of rule involving ambiguous molecularity
  are in {} instead of ()
